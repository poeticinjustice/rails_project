**JOBLOG**

This is just an early description of the project. I will prepare a more complete version of the project tonight, after I've completed the blog portion of it.

First, I will make a blog using the blog project that I was working on Thurday night to keep my repetitions up and solidify my understanding of rails. I will complete that tonight:
http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

I will then connect New York's open API to the blog. Once a user finds a job that they like, they will be able to pull the url from the api, and it will create a blog post, using the url from the api and a title that the user would create, possibly allowing the title to be automatically generated based on the title in the API

Comments could be added to the blog to track progress

Will likely use HTTParty to access database
